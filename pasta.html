        <h1>pasta</h1>
        <p> Craving a simple, cozy pasta? Try this Classic Red Sauce Pasta recipe! Like any great Italian recipe, it features simple, classic ingredients simmered until they meld into a savory, velvety tomato sauce. This one is based on a real Italian grandmother’s recipe (so you know it’s good!). Throw it onto pasta with a little salty Parmesan or Pecorino Romano cheese, and it’s simply divine. This one went over very well in our house: each of us huddled over our cozy bowls…and refusing to share!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
